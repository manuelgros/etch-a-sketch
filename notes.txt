Etch A Sketch Version 1:

Goal:
A simple web application with a 16x16 grid that poses as a canvas. The user will be able to draw on this canvas, by turning the tiles of the grid from white
to black by hovering over it with the cursor. The application should also have a button to reset the canvas to its original state so the user can start over.
Even though the goal at this state is a very simplistic application, the code should be "flexible" enough so I can built upon it later, and implement more 
sophisticated function (different grid sizes, color adjustments, eraser etc.)

Pseudocode:

  Javascript:
  
  Create a 16x16 grid inside the div #canvas  
    Write Loop that creates an array canvasTiles[] of items based on two arguments (height and width of Grit exp.: function grit(16, 16) => 16*16 = 256 items in array )
    Write Loop that takes canvasTiles[] and makes each item a Div element (tile 1, tile2 etc...) with the class .tile inside the Div #canvas

  
  
  CSS:
  
  Canvas:
  set size for canvas

  Tiles:
  Size of Tiles should adjust so to fit into Canvas
