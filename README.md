# etch-a-sketch
TOP Project: Etch-A-Sketch Web-Application

In this project I will built a painting and sketching tool for images in 
pixel art style. I will use javascript for the majority of the code with some HTML. Styling will be done with CSS.
Besides the main function of the application I am aiming for an ecstatically pleasing UI and design.

This project is part of the "Foundation Course" of the Odin Project.
